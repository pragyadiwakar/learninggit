Using GitHub makes it easier to collaborate
 with colleagues and peers and look back at
 previous versions of your work.
 It is a great platform to work and engage with
 other people to make your project better 
and more efficient



Our project is a skeleton. It does what you 
want it to do, but youâ€™re not always sure how the
 Others  will implement it or if it 
even works for everyone.
It provides an environment that encourages
 the improvement of code. 
It also provides a system with which 
coders can keep track of their changes
 made during the coding process.
